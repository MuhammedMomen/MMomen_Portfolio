AI Agent Theme Manager
Real-Time AI-Driven Design System for Flet
The AI Agent Theme Manager is a sophisticated project designed to bridge the gap between static UI styling and dynamic, AI-orchestrated environments. It provides a robust framework for generating, applying, and managing complex application themes in real-time, leveraging Google's Generative AI.

💡 Core Idea & Vision
The project emerged from the need to control UI themes via AI in real-time, aligning with modern AG-UI (Agentic User Interface) frameworks. Instead of traditional, hardcoded style sheets, this project treats the "UI Theme" as a dynamic artifact that can be reasoned about and generated by an AI agent. This allows for:

Intuitive Design: Creating professional themes through natural language prompts.
Real-Time Adaptation: Instant UI updates based on contextual or agentic triggers.
Consistency-as-a-Service: Ensuring all components maintain a unified design language without manual styling.
🚀 Key Features
1. Generative AI Theme Engine
Creative Director Agent: Utilizes Gemini-2.0-pro to act as a design system architect.
Theme Enrichment: Can take a simple concept (e.g., "Cyberpunk") and expand it into a full design philosophy, including color psychology, typography hierarchy, and spatial design strategy.
Dual-Mode Synthesis: Automatically generates balanced Light and Dark mode schemes that ensure high contrast and visual harmony across the entire application.
2. Real-Time "Hot-Theming"
Instant Application: Themes are applied to the running application instantly via a dedicated 
AdvancedThemeManager
.
Recursive Theme Builder: A robust, defensive parser maps AI-generated JSON into complex Flet/Flutter objects like TextStyle, ButtonStyle, and PageTransitions.
Directory Watcher: Monitors the 
themes/
 folder in the background. If a theme file is updated or a new one is added, the application reflects the changes immediately without a restart.
3. Comprehensive Theme Coverage
The system provides deep, granular control over nearly every Material 3 component in Flet:

Core Palette: Color schemes, seeds, and surface variants.
Navigation: AppBars, Navigation Bars, Drawers, and Rails.
Buttons & Inputs: All button variants, Textfields, Checkboxes, Switches, and Sliders.
Content Containers: Cards, ListTiles, ExpansionTiles, and Data Tables.
Feedback & Overlays: Dialogs, Bottom Sheets, Snackbars, and Progress Indicators.
4. Interactive Management UI
Theme Preview Sandbox: A live preview area where developers can see how components look under the active theme.
AI generation Dialog: A built-in GUI for prompting the AI to create new themes or enrich existing descriptions.
Visual Branding: Each theme is associated with a dynamic gradient preview based on its primary color scheme.
🛠️ Technical Stack
Language: Python
Frontend Framework: Flet: A framework to build interactive web, desktop, and mobile apps in Python.
AI Integration: LangChain with Google Generative AI (gemini-2.0-pro).
State Management: Asynchronous event handling and background threads for file monitoring.
Data Structure: Hierarchical JSON models derived from Material Design 3 specifications.

🎯 Alignment with AG-UI
In the context of AG-UI, this project serves as the visual "rendering engine" for an agent. It allows an AI agent to not only communicate via text but to also manipulate its own physical appearance and visual language to better suit the user's needs or the current task's urgency.
